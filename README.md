# LanguageFlashCardApp
Flash card app developed using tkinter and pandas in Python to learn the 250 most common words in Spanish!
Flash card will flip around after 3 seconds to reveal the English translation, the red button is for when you need more practice with the word, while the green button means you know the word well and it will be removed from the word list the next time the program is run.
The app initially takes the Spanish word/translation data from "spanishflash.csv" consisting of the 250 most common Spanish words.
In ensuing iterations of the program, words will be taken from "to_learn.csv", which removes the words the user confirmed they don't need practice on.
